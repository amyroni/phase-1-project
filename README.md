This application allows the user to search for books from the current New York Times bestsellers lists, view the details of each book, leave comments on books, and save books to a wishlist. 

When searching for a besteller list, as the user begins typing, the search form will provide suggestions for list names that contain the letters and/or words that the user has typed into the search bar. The suggested list names include all current NYT bestseller lists currently in existence.

Once a book is in the user's wishlist, the heart icon on the relevant book will turn red, and the add-to-wishlist button will be disabled, so the user would not be able to add the book to their card again. Books that are in the user's wishlist can be removed. Once removed, the heart icon on the relevant book will revert back to an empty heart and the add-to-wishlist button will be enabled again.

When viewing details of a book, the user will also see any comments that exist relating to the book. (These comments are saved to and pulled from our local database, not NYT.) The user can also leave their own comment on the book.

The user's wishlist, comments, the state of the heart icon on each book, and the state of the add-to-wishlist button persist with any page refreshes or any new list-name searches.
